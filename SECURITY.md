# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Equipment Rental Application and provides guidelines for maintaining security in production environments.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based authentication** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (user/admin)
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with salt rounds 12
- **Rate limiting** on authentication endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- **Input validation** for all user inputs

### 2. Database Security
- **Parameterized queries** to prevent SQL injection
- **Database constraints** for data integrity
- **Proper foreign key relationships** with CASCADE delete
- **Input validation** at database level
- **Indexes** for performance and security

### 3. API Security
- **Helmet.js** for security headers
- **CORS configuration** with origin validation
- **Rate limiting** on all API endpoints
- **Request size limits** (10MB)
- **Input sanitization** and validation

### 4. Environment Security
- **Environment variable validation** on startup
- **Secure defaults** for all configurations
- **No hardcoded secrets** in code
- **Production/development** environment separation

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Change default JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Update database credentials
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up HTTPS in production
- [ ] Configure proper logging
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Ongoing Security
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Security audits
- [ ] Log monitoring
- [ ] Backup verification
- [ ] Access control reviews

## Default Credentials

### Admin User
- **Email**: admin@rentals.com
- **Password**: Admin@123! (CHANGE IMMEDIATELY)

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables
```bash
# Backend
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_here_minimum_32_characters_long
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
DB_NAME=rentals_db

# Frontend
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_here_minimum_32_characters_long
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
```

## Security Best Practices

### Password Policy
- Minimum 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- No common passwords allowed

### JWT Configuration
- Use strong, random secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Set appropriate expiration times
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Limit database user permissions
- Enable SSL connections in production
- Regular backups with encryption

### API Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper error handling
- Log security events
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Steps
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Change all passwords and secrets
   - Review access logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify breach scope
   - Document findings
   - Notify stakeholders

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security documentation
